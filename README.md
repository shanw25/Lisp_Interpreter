# Lisp Interpreter

This project is an extension of a Java Lisp interpreter skeleton, originally implemented by Anna Vitkus. It enhances the existing framework by adding new functionalities, creating a rudimentary Lisp interpreter utilizing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. The goal is to provide a basic but functional Lisp interpreter environment in Java.

## Features

- Interpret basic Lisp expressions.
- MVC architecture for easy extension and maintenance.
- Lightweight and straightforward setup.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the Lisp Interpreter on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- JDK (Java Development Kit) - Version 11 is recommended for compatibility.

You can check your Java version by running:
```bash
java -version
```

# Running the Program

Follow these steps to get the program running on your system.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine using the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shanw25/Lisp_Interpreter.git
```

## Step 2: Open the Project

Open the cloned project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports Java. The project was developed using Java 11, so it is recommended to use the same JDK version to avoid compatibility issues.

## Step 3: Run the Interpreter

1, Locate index.java in the project structure.
2, Run index.java using your IDE's built-in run function.

# How to Use

After running index.java, the program will await input in the console. Start entering Lisp code expressions following standard Lisp syntax. The interpreter will evaluate the expressions and return the results in the console.
